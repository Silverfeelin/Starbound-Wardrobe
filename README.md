# Starbound Wardrobe

Starbound Wardrobe is a mod that uses Stardust Core Lite (or [Quickbar Mini][qbm]) to add an easily accessible interface that you can use to dress up your character.

In the interface you can select any clothing available in the game. A character preview will show you exactly what the items look like on your character, and you can directly spawn or equip your outfit.  
Have mods installed? There might be an [add-on](#add-ons) available for the Wardrobe!

If you're happy with your outfit, you can also save it for later use.

## Installation

* [Download](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe/releases) the release for the current version of Starbound.
* Unpack the archive.
* Place the `Wardrobe.pak` file in your mods folder (eg. `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\mods\`).
* Optionally, place the `QuickbarMini.pak` in the same mods folder. This step is necessary if you don't have the mod (or StardustLib) yet.
  * If the bundled version is older than the current version of the [Quickbar Mini][qbmRelease] mod, it is recommended to download and use that release instead.

## Usage

##### Opening the interface

* Open the matter manipulator upgrade panel.
* Select 'Open Wardrobe' from the available options.

Don't worry, the bundled [Quickbar Mini][qbm] mod ensures you still have access to the original functionality of the upgrade panel! This menu is used for the mod as it's multiplayer-friendly and can be accessed anywhere.

##### Using the interface

After opening the interface, you will be presented with a preview of your character. From here, you can try out different clothing and dyes.

The functionality of the interface is shown in the below images.

## Add-ons

The [Starbound-Wardrobe-Addons](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe-Addons) repository houses various add-ons that can be used to add clothing from mods to the Wardrobe. These add-ons can be installed like any other mod.

The repository also contains information on how to create add-ons for the Wardrobe, if you're interested in creating new or updating existing add-ons.

More information can be found on the repository itself.

## Integrations

With both mods installed, a new color option will appear on each slot. By selecting this color option your selection in the Dye Suite are applied to the Wardrobe items.

> Keep in mind this may only work if both mods are installed on Steam _or_ both outside of Steam.
